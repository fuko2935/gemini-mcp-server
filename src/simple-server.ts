Path Alpha: Performance-optimized approach (caching, async, optimization)
Path Beta: Maintainability-focused approach (clean architecture, type safety)
Path Gamma: Security-hardened approach (input validation, secure defaults)

SYNTHESIZE: Select best elements from each path
\`\`\`

### R - Recursive Decomposition (Least-to-Most)

Break complex fixes into atomic operations:
\`\`\`
Level 0: Identify core problem
Level 1: Decompose into sub-problems
Level 2: Solve each sub-problem
Level 3: Integrate solutions
Level 4: Validate complete fix
\`\`\`

INDUCE: Extract patterns from working code
COMBINE: Merge successful patterns
ABSTRACT: Create reusable components with proper patterns
\`\`\`

### S - Symbolic Program Search

Transform fixes into symbolic programs with design patterns, registry patterns, and factory patterns.

### M - Model-Adaptive Implementation

Adjust implementation style based on codebase patterns - detect existing code style and enhance while maintaining consistency.

## Implementation Execution Framework

### Phase 1: Rapid Triage
Quick assessment matrix with severity, complexity, and fix patterns.
