- **Current efficiency**: ${Math.min(100, (totalKeys / 10) * 100).toFixed(1)}%

## 🚀 Usage Tips
${totalKeys === 0 ? `
❌ **No API keys configured!**
- Add keys to geminiApiKeys field: "key1,key2,key3"
- Or set environment variable: GEMINI_API_KEY
- Get keys from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
` : totalKeys === 1 ? `
⚠️ **Single key detected**
- Consider adding more keys for better rate limit protection
- Use comma-separated format: "key1,key2,key3"
- Or individual fields: geminiApiKey2, geminiApiKey3, etc.
` : `
✅ **Multi-key configuration active**
- Rate limit protection is active
- Automatic failover enabled
- Optimal performance achieved
`}

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Rate limits**: With ${totalKeys} keys, you can handle ${totalKeys}x more requests
